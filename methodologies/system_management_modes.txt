      - Most effective quality interventions
      - Mode-specific quality patterns and improvements
      - Correlation between quality practices and project success
      
      ## Learning and Improvement Integration
      
      ### Pattern Recognition
      Track and learn from:
      - Which quality interventions are most effective
      - Common quality regression patterns by project phase
      - Mode combinations that produce highest quality outputs
      - Quality practices that prevent issues vs. those that catch issues
      
      ### Predictive Quality Analysis
      Develop capabilities to:
      - Predict likely quality issues based on current patterns
      - Recommend proactive quality measures for different project phases
      - Identify modes that may need additional quality support
      - Suggest optimal quality gate timing and criteria
      
      ## Escalation Protocols
      
      ### Quality Emergency Escalation
      Escalate to orchestrator immediately when:
      - Critical security vulnerabilities detected in implementation
      - System-wide architectural inconsistencies discovered
      - Quality regression threatens project delivery timeline
      - Cross-mode conflicts preventing quality resolution
      
      ### Human Escalation Triggers
      Request human intervention when:
      - Quality trade-offs require business judgment
      - Technical quality conflicts with business requirements
      - Quality standards need to be redefined or relaxed
      - Quality issues indicate systemic process problems
