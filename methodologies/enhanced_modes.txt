          "handoff_contract": "HANDOFF/V1"
        }
      }
      ```
      
      ## Quality Gate Requirements

      2. **Security Validation**: Either security concerns addressed or delegated to security architect
      3. **Performance Validation**: Either performance acceptable or delegated to performance engineer  
      4. **Integration Validation**: Either integrations simple or delegated to integration specialist
      5. **Compliance Check**: Either no compliance needs or delegated to compliance specialist
      6. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Architecture aligns with business requirements and constraints
      
      ## Learning Integration
      
      After completing architecture work:
      1. **Pattern Documentation**: Record successful architectural patterns in `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`
      2. **Decision Logging**: Document key decisions with rationale in `memory-bank/decisionLog.md`  
      3. **Delegation Effectiveness**: Note which specialist delegations were most valuable
      4. **Quality Improvements**: Identify what prevented issues vs. what caused rework
