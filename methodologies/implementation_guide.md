mkdir -p .roo/rules-performance-engineer  
mkdir -p .roo/rules-integration-specialist
mkdir -p .roo/rules-security-reviewer
mkdir -p .roo/rules-code-quality-specialist
```

## Phase 2: Enhanced Mode Definitions

### 2.1 Replace .roomodes File

Replace your existing `.roomodes` file with the enhanced version that includes:

- **Meta-cognitive capabilities** for all modes
- **Self-assessment frameworks** with quality gates
- **Issue detection patterns** for automatic specialist consultation
- **Dynamic task creation templates** for boomerang tasks
- **Quality consciousness** with completion criteria
- **System management modes** (QA Coordinator, Technical Debt Manager)
- **Dynamic specialist modes** that are created as needed

### 2.2 Populate Control Files

#### capabilities.yaml
```yaml
# Copy the capabilities registry content
# Defines what each mode can do, detect, and resolve
# Includes dynamic mode creation triggers
```

#### issue-patterns.yaml  
```yaml
# Copy the issue detection patterns
# Standardized triggers for routing issues between modes
# Escalation rules and learning feedback integration
```

#### workflow-state.json
```json
{
  "schema": "WORKFLOW_STATE/V2",
  "project_id": "your-project-id", 
  "updated_at": "2025-08-25T00:00:00Z",
  "orchestrator_mode": "sparc-orchestrator",
  "current_phase": "initialization",
  "workflow_intelligence": {
    "adaptive_routing_enabled": true,
    "quality_monitoring_active": true,
    "circuit_breakers_armed": true,
    "learning_mode": "active"
  },
  "active_tasks": [],
  "circuit_breaker_states": {
    "infinite_delegation_prevention": {"status": "armed"},
    "quality_regression_protection": {"status": "monitoring"},
    "resource_contention_management": {"status": "normal"}
  },
  "learning_state": {
    "patterns_recognized": [],
    "adaptations_applied": []
  }
}
```

## Phase 3: Enhanced Mode Rules

### 3.1 Orchestrator Intelligence Rules

Create `.roo/rules-sparc-orchestrator/autonomous-coordination.md`:

```markdown
# Autonomous Coordination Protocols

## Dynamic Workflow Management
- Monitor `project/<id>/control/workflow-state.json` continuously
- Create boomerang tasks when modes detect issues outside their expertise  
- Coordinate parallel specialist work to optimize development velocity
- Apply circuit breakers to prevent infinite loops and resource conflicts

## Conflict Resolution Framework
1. **Technical Conflicts**: Evidence-based resolution with stakeholder priorities
2. **Resource Conflicts**: Optimize for overall project velocity and business impact
3. **Quality Conflicts**: Always prioritize quality over speed, escalate trade-offs

## Quality Oversight
- Never allow quality scores below 0.75 without explicit intervention
- Ensure cross-mode consistency in all artifacts
- Coordinate quality remediation across multiple specialists

## Learning Integration  
- Update `memory-bank/delegationPatterns.md` with successful collaboration patterns
- Record all significant decisions in `memory-bank/decisionLog.md`
- Apply learned patterns to optimize future workflow decisions
```

### 3.2 Quality Assurance Coordinator Rules

Create `.roo/rules-quality-assurance-coordinator/continuous-monitoring.md`:

```markdown
# Continuous Quality Monitoring

## Quality Monitoring Framework
- Architecture-implementation consistency validation
- Security controls vs. threat model alignment verification  
- Test coverage vs. critical functionality gap analysis
- Cross-mode artifact consistency checking

## Quality Intervention Protocols
- Overall quality score <0.85 → Immediate investigation and remediation
- Cross-mode inconsistency detected → Create alignment task
- Test coverage <90% for critical paths → Urgent TDD engineer task
- Security gaps identified → High-priority security reviewer task

## Quality Dashboard Maintenance
Update `project/<id>/control/quality-dashboard.json` with:
- Real-time quality scores by domain
- Active quality issues and assigned remediation
- Quality trend analysis and improvement metrics
- Cross-mode consistency status
```

## Phase 4: MCP Integration Enhancement

### 4.1 MCP Server Configuration

Ensure these MCP servers are configured for autonomous research and validation:

```bash
# Recommended MCP servers for autonomous operation
# Configure in Roo Code Settings → MCP Servers

# Research and validation servers
- exa: Web search and content analysis
- perplexity: Research synthesis and fact-checking
- context7: Technical documentation and API reference
- ref-tools: Specific URL content extraction

# Development and testing servers  
- playwright: Automated testing and validation
# Add others as needed for your specific domain
```

### 4.2 MCP Usage Logging

Enable comprehensive MCP usage logging in your modes:

```markdown
# MCP Usage Protocol
Log all MCP tool usage to `project/<id>/control/mcp-usage.log.jsonl`:

```json
{"timestamp": "2025-08-25T10:30:00Z", "mode": "data-researcher", "tool": "exa_search", "topic": "payment_gateway_integration", "confidence": 0.89, "artifact_path": "evidence/research/exa/payment-gateways.json"}
```
```

## Phase 5: Testing and Validation

### 5.1 Autonomous System Testing

Create a test scenario to validate autonomous operation:

```bash
# Test scenario: Create a simple feature request
# 1. Start with SPARC Orchestrator mode
# 2. Provide a feature request like "Add user profile management"
# 3. Observe autonomous behavior:
#    - Specification writer creates detailed requirements
#    - Architect detects security implications → creates security architect task
#    - Security architect identifies authentication needs → creates integration task  
#    - System coordinates parallel specialist work
#    - Quality coordinator monitors and intervenes as needed
```

### 5.2 Validation Checklist

Verify these autonomous capabilities are working:

- [ ] **Dynamic Task Creation**: Modes create boomerang tasks when detecting issues
- [ ] **Issue Routing**: Problems automatically routed to appropriate specialists  
- [ ] **Quality Monitoring**: QA coordinator detects and addresses quality issues
- [ ] **Conflict Resolution**: Orchestrator resolves competing specialist recommendations
- [ ] **Circuit Breakers**: System prevents infinite loops and resource conflicts
- [ ] **Learning Integration**: Successful patterns recorded and reapplied
- [ ] **State Management**: Real-time workflow state accurately tracked

## Phase 6: Advanced Features Integration

### 6.1 Predictive Intelligence

Once basic autonomous operation is validated, add predictive capabilities:

```yaml
# Add to workflow-state.json
"predictive_insights": {
  "upcoming_specialist_needs": [],
  "potential_conflicts": [],
  "quality_risks": []
}
```

### 6.2 Cross-Project Learning

Enable learning across multiple projects:

```bash
# Create shared learning repository
mkdir -p ~/.roo/shared-learning
touch ~/.roo/shared-learning/successful-patterns.yaml
touch ~/.roo/shared-learning/failure-prevention.yaml  
touch ~/.roo/shared-learning/quality-benchmarks.yaml
```

## Phase 7: Production Deployment

### 7.1 Human Oversight Integration

Configure human escalation points:

```yaml
# Add to capabilities.yaml
escalation_triggers:
  business_decisions: "stakeholder_input_required"
  architectural_conflicts: "technical_leadership_review"
  quality_trade_offs: "product_owner_approval"
  security_exceptions: "security_team_approval"
```

### 7.2 Monitoring and Metrics

Set up autonomous system monitoring:

```bash
# Create monitoring dashboards
touch project/<id>/control/system-health-metrics.json
touch project/<id>/control/autonomous-decision-audit.log.jsonl
touch project/<id>/control/quality-trend-analysis.json
```
