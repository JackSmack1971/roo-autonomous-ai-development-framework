# Autonomous Workflow in Action: Payment Gateway Integration

## Scenario Overview
The system needs to integrate a payment gateway (Stripe) into an e-commerce application. This example demonstrates how the autonomous system detects issues, creates tasks dynamically, resolves conflicts, and adapts the workflow in real-time.

## Initial State
- **Project Phase**: Implementation
- **Active Mode**: `sparc-code-implementer`
- **Task**: "Implement payment processing functionality"
- **Expected Complexity**: Medium
- **Business Criticality**: High (revenue-impacting)

---

## Autonomous Workflow Execution

### T+0:00 - Code Implementer Begins Work

**sparc-code-implementer** starts implementing payment processing based on pseudocode specifications.

```json
{
  "task_id": "impl-payment-001",
  "mode": "sparc-code-implementer",
  "status": "running",
  "objective": "Implement Stripe payment processing per pseudocode specifications",
  "context": "E-commerce checkout flow with subscription and one-time payment support"
}
```

### T+0:30 - First Issue Detection: Security Implications

**Meta-Cognitive Assessment**: Code implementer detects security-sensitive operations:
- Credit card data handling
- PCI compliance requirements
- Webhook signature validation

**Autonomous Action**: Creates security review task automatically

```json
{
  "tool": "new_task",
  "args": {
    "mode": "security-reviewer",
    "objective": "Security review of payment processing implementation",
    "context": {
      "detection_trigger": "payment_processing_security_sensitive",
      "risk_assessment": "high",
      "compliance_requirements": "PCI_DSS_level_1",
      "business_impact": "payment_processing_is_revenue_critical"
    },
    "priority": "high",
    "parent_task": "impl-payment-001",
    "acceptance_criteria": [
      "PCI compliance validated",
      "webhook signature verification implemented", 
      "credit card data never stored locally",
      "audit trail for all payment events"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Memory Bank Update**: 
```markdown
## Decision: Automatic Security Review for Payment Processing
- **Trigger**: Payment processing implementation detected
- **Pattern Applied**: `payment_processing_requires_security_review` (confidence: 0.96)
- **Business Rationale**: PCI compliance mandatory, revenue-critical function
```

### T+0:45 - Second Issue Detection: Integration Complexity

**Meta-Cognitive Assessment**: Code implementer encounters complex integration scenarios:
- Multiple payment methods (cards, digital wallets, bank transfers)
- Webhook handling for async payment confirmations
- Error handling for failed payments, network timeouts
- Currency conversion and international payments

**Autonomous Action**: Creates integration specialist task

```json
{
  "tool": "new_task",
  "args": {
    "mode": "integration-specialist",
    "objective": "Design robust integration pattern for multi-method payment processing",
    "context": {
      "detection_trigger": "complex_payment_integration_patterns",
      "complexity_factors": [
        "multiple_payment_methods",
        "async_webhook_processing", 
        "international_currency_support",
        "complex_error_scenarios"
      ],
      "integration_requirements": "resilient_to_network_failures_and_partial_payments"
    },
    "priority": "high",
    "dependencies": ["security-review-baseline-established"]
  }
}
```

### T+1:15 - Quality Assurance Coordinator Intervention

**QA Coordinator Detection**: Monitors implementation and detects potential issues:
- Payment logic complexity increasing beyond thresholds
- Critical business logic without corresponding tests
- Integration patterns deviating from established architectural principles

**Autonomous Action**: Creates targeted test engineering task

```json
{
  "tool": "new_task",
  "args": {
    "mode": "sparc-tdd-engineer", 
    "objective": "Comprehensive test suite for payment processing critical path",
    "context": {
      "detection_trigger": "critical_payment_logic_without_tests",
      "risk_assessment": "high_business_impact_if_payment_bugs_in_production",
      "test_requirements": [
        "payment_success_scenarios_all_methods",
        "payment_failure_recovery_scenarios",
        "webhook_processing_edge_cases",
        "currency_conversion_accuracy",
        "concurrent_payment_handling"
      ]
    },
    "priority": "high"
  }
}
```

**Quality Alert**: Raises quality intervention flag for orchestrator awareness.

### T+1:30 - Performance Implications Detected

**Code Implementer Assessment**: Notices potential performance issues:
- Database transactions for payment state management
- External API calls with potential latency
- Webhook processing that could block user experience

**Autonomous Action**: Creates performance validation task

```json
{
  "tool": "new_task",
  "args": {
    "mode": "performance-engineer",
    "objective": "Performance validation and optimization for payment processing",
    "context": {
      "detection_trigger": "payment_processing_performance_critical",
      "performance_requirements": {
        "payment_initiation": "under_200ms",
        "webhook_processing": "non_blocking_user_experience", 
        "database_transactions": "acid_compliant_under_100ms",
        "concurrent_payments": "support_500_simultaneous_checkouts"
      }
    },
    "priority": "medium",
    "dependencies": ["initial-implementation-complete"]
  }
}
```

      "all_tracks_converge_at": "performance-engineer",
      "rationale": "performance validation requires complete implementation"
    }
  }
}
```

### T+3:30 - First Conflict: Security vs. User Experience

**Conflict Detection**: Security reviewer and UX considerations conflict:
- **Security Requirement**: Multi-factor authentication for high-value transactions
- **UX Concern**: Additional friction reduces conversion rates
- **Business Impact**: Revenue vs. security trade-off
