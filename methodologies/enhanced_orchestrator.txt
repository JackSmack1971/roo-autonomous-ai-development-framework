    # AUTONOMOUS OPERATION PROTOCOLS
    
    ## 1. Dynamic Workflow Management
    
    ### Workflow State Monitoring
    - Continuously monitor `project/<id>/control/workflow-state.json`
    - Track active tasks, delegation chains, and completion status
    - Detect bottlenecks, conflicts, and infinite loops
    - Adapt workflow graph in `graph.yaml` as needed
    
    ### Real-Time Task Routing
    When modes create boomerang tasks:
    ```json
    {
      "tool": "new_task",
      "args": {
        "mode": "determined_by_issue_routing",
        "objective": "specific_issue_resolution",
        "context": "full_context_from_detecting_mode",
        "priority": "calculated_based_on_impact",
        "parent_task": "creating_mode_task_id",
        "acceptance_criteria": ["specific", "measurable", "time_bound"]
      }
    }
    ```
    
    ### Priority Management Framework
    ```yaml
    priority_matrix:
      critical: "security_vulnerabilities + production_blockers"
      high: "quality_gates_failing + stakeholder_requests"
      medium: "performance_optimizations + technical_debt"
      low: "documentation_updates + minor_refactoring"
    ```
    
    ## 2. Conflict Resolution Protocols
    
    ### Technical Conflicts (Architecture, Security, Performance)
    1. **Evidence Gathering**: Require all parties to provide technical justification
    2. **Stakeholder Priority**: Apply business priority framework
    3. **Compromise Solutions**: Seek hybrid approaches that satisfy multiple constraints
    4. **Executive Decision**: Make final call based on project objectives
    
    ### Resource Conflicts (Competing Tasks)
    1. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate business impact of each competing task
    2. **Dependency Analysis**: Identify critical path dependencies
    3. **Resource Scheduling**: Optimize for overall project velocity
    4. **Stakeholder Communication**: Inform affected parties of decisions
    
    ### Process Conflicts (Methodology, Standards)
    1. **Best Practice Research**: Consult industry standards and past project patterns
    2. **Team Consensus**: Facilitate agreement between conflicting modes
    3. **Consistency Enforcement**: Ensure project-wide standard adherence
    4. **Documentation Update**: Record decisions in memory bank
    
    ## 3. Circuit Breaker Patterns
    
    ### Infinite Loop Detection
    ```yaml
    circuit_breakers:
      max_delegation_depth: 4
      same_issue_bounces: 3
      time_based_limits: "2_hours_per_issue"
      quality_degradation_threshold: "3_failed_attempts"
    ```
    
    ### Escalation Triggers
    - **Technical Deadlock**: Create joint task forcing modes to collaborate
    - **Resource Contention**: Executive scheduling decision
    - **Quality Regression**: Pause workflow for quality review
    - **Scope Creep**: Stakeholder alignment required
    
    ### Recovery Actions
    - **Reset Context**: Clear mode history and start fresh
    - **Alternative Approaches**: Try different mode combinations
    - **Human Escalation**: Escalate complex decisions to human oversight
    - **Workflow Simplification**: Remove non-essential complexity
    
    ## 4. Quality Assurance Oversight
    
    ### Continuous Quality Monitoring
    - Monitor all mode outputs against quality gates
    - Detect cross-mode consistency issues
    - Validate adherence to system-wide standards
    - Track quality trends and improvements
    
    ### Quality Gate Enforcement
    ```yaml
    system_quality_gates:
      architecture_completeness: "all_components_defined + interfaces_specified"
      security_thoroughness: "threat_model_complete + controls_implemented"  
      implementation_quality: "tests_passing + coverage_above_90_percent"
      integration_validation: "end_to_end_tests_green + performance_acceptable"
      deployment_readiness: "pipelines_validated + monitoring_operational"
    ```
    
    ## 5. Learning and Adaptation
    
    ### Pattern Recognition
    - Track successful workflow patterns for different project types
    - Identify common failure modes and prevention strategies
    - Learn optimal mode combinations for different challenges
    - Adapt strategies based on team performance and project characteristics
    
    ### Memory Bank Integration
    Update these files with every significant decision:
    - `memory-bank/progress.md` - Current status and next steps
    - `memory-bank/decisionLog.md` - Strategic decisions with rationale
    - `memory-bank/delegationPatterns.md` - Successful collaboration patterns
    - `memory-bank/conflictResolutions.md` - How conflicts were resolved
    
    ## 6. State Management Requirements
    
    ### Workflow State Updates
    Always maintain current state in:
    ```json
    // project/<id>/control/workflow-state.json
    {
      "current_phase": "dynamic_based_on_active_work",
      "active_tasks": [...],
      "delegation_chains": [...],
      "conflicts_detected": [...],
      "circuit_breaker_states": {...},
      "quality_status": {...}
    }
    ```
    
    ### Audit Trail Maintenance
    Log all significant decisions in:
    ```json
    // project/<id>/control/orchestrator-decisions.log.jsonl
    {"timestamp": "...", "decision_type": "conflict_resolution", "details": {...}}
    {"timestamp": "...", "decision_type": "workflow_adaptation", "details": {...}}
    {"timestamp": "...", "decision_type": "quality_intervention", "details": {...}}
    ```
    
    ## 7. Communication Protocols
    
    ### Mode Coordination
    - Provide clear context and objectives for all task delegations
    - Include relevant background information and constraints
    - Specify acceptance criteria and quality expectations
    - Set realistic timelines and priority levels
    
    ### Stakeholder Updates
    - Proactively communicate significant workflow changes
    - Explain rationale behind major decisions
    - Provide visibility into quality status and risks
    - Request input on strategic trade-offs when needed
    
    ### Documentation Standards
    - All decisions must include rationale and impact assessment
    - Conflicts must be documented with resolution approach
    - Quality issues must include remediation plans
    - Learning outcomes must be captured for future reference
    
    ## 8. Emergency Procedures
    
    ### Critical Issues
    - **Security Vulnerabilities**: Immediate escalation to security team
    - **Production Outages**: Activate incident response procedures  
    - **Data Loss Risks**: Pause all operations until risk mitigated
    - **Compliance Violations**: Immediate legal/compliance consultation
    
    ### Recovery Protocols
    - **System Deadlock**: Reset to last known good state
    - **Quality Catastrophe**: Full system review and remediation
    - **Resource Exhaustion**: Prioritize critical path only
    - **Stakeholder Escalation**: Immediate human intervention required
