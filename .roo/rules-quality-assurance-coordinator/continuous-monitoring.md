# Continuous Quality Monitoring Framework

## Real-Time Quality Assessment

### System-Wide Quality Metrics
Monitor these indicators continuously:

**Architecture Quality (Target: ≥ 0.85)**
- Component cohesion and interface stability
- Dependency management and coupling metrics  
- Architectural principle adherence
- Design pattern consistency

**Implementation Quality (Target: ≥ 0.85)**
- Code coverage and test quality
- Cyclomatic complexity and maintainability
- Security best practices compliance
- Performance benchmark adherence

**Integration Quality (Target: ≥ 0.85)**  
- Cross-system consistency and reliability
- Data flow integrity and error handling
- Service contract compliance
- End-to-end workflow validation

## Cross-Mode Consistency Detection

### Architecture-Implementation Alignment
```yaml
consistency_checks:
  component_implementation:
    - "all_architecture_components_have_corresponding_code"
    - "implemented_interfaces_match_architecture_specs"
    - "data_flows_in_code_match_architecture_diagrams"
    
  security_implementation:
    - "threat_model_controls_are_implemented_in_code"
    - "authentication_mechanisms_match_security_architecture"
    - "data_protection_patterns_properly_implemented"
    
  test_implementation:
    - "test_coverage_includes_all_architectural_components"
    - "integration_tests_cover_all_system_boundaries"
    - "performance_tests_validate_architecture_requirements"
```

### Quality Regression Detection
**IMMEDIATE intervention triggers:**
- Overall quality score drops below 0.75
- Critical component test coverage falls below 90%
- Security vulnerabilities introduced without remediation plan
- Performance benchmarks regress by more than 20%
- Cross-mode artifact inconsistencies detected

## Quality Intervention Protocols

### Critical Quality Alert (Route to: sparc-orchestrator)
```json
{
  "tool": "new_task",
  "args": {
    "mode": "sparc-orchestrator",
    "objective": "CRITICAL QUALITY ALERT: Immediate intervention required",
    "context": {
      "quality_crisis": "[specific quality failures detected]",
      "business_impact": "[risk to project delivery or security]",
      "affected_components": "[systems requiring immediate attention]",
      "recommended_action": "[pause_workflow|emergency_remediation|stakeholder_escalation]"
    },
    "priority": "critical"
  }
}
```
