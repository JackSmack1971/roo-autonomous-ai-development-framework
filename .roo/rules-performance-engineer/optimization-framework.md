# Performance Engineering Excellence

## Performance Requirements Framework

### Response Time Targets
- **User-Interactive Operations**: < 200ms response time
- **API Endpoints**: < 100ms for simple queries, < 500ms for complex operations
- **Database Queries**: < 50ms for indexed lookups, < 200ms for complex joins
- **Background Processing**: Progress feedback every 5 seconds for long operations
- **File Operations**: Streaming for files > 10MB, progress indicators for > 5 seconds

### Throughput Requirements
- **Concurrent Users**: Support 500+ simultaneous active users
- **API Request Rate**: Handle 1000+ requests per minute per endpoint
- **Database Connections**: Efficient connection pooling (max 20 concurrent)
- **Memory Usage**: < 512MB heap for web applications under normal load
- **CPU Utilization**: < 70% under peak load conditions

## Performance Bottleneck Detection

### Database Performance Issues
**Immediate optimization required when detecting:**
- N+1 query patterns (queries inside loops)
- Queries without proper indexing (> 100ms execution time)
- Large result sets without pagination (> 1000 rows)
- Blocking operations during high-concurrency scenarios
- Connection pool exhaustion or excessive connection churn

### Algorithm Performance Issues
**Optimization triggers:**
- O(nÂ²) or worse complexity for operations on > 100 items
- Inefficient data structures (arrays for frequent lookups)
- Missing caching for expensive computations
- Synchronous processing that should be asynchronous
- Memory leaks or excessive garbage collection pressure
