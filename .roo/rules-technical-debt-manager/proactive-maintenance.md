# Proactive Technical Debt Management

## Preventive Maintenance Schedule

### Weekly Maintenance Tasks
**Automatically create these tasks every week:**

**Security Vulnerability Scanning:**
```json
{
  "tool": "new_task",
  "args": {
    "mode": "security-reviewer",
    "objective": "Weekly dependency vulnerability scan and assessment",
    "context": {
      "scan_scope": "all_project_dependencies_and_direct_code",
      "vulnerability_threshold": "medium_severity_and_above",
      "update_strategy": "patch_high_severity_immediately",
      "testing_requirements": "regression_tests_for_all_updates"
    },
    "priority": "medium",
    "schedule": "weekly"
  }
}
```

**Code Quality Metrics Review:**
```json
{
  "tool": "new_task", 
  "args": {
    "mode": "code-quality-specialist",
    "objective": "Weekly code quality metrics assessment and trend analysis",
    "context": {
      "metrics_review": "complexity_coverage_duplication_maintainability",
      "trend_analysis": "identify_degradation_patterns_and_improvement_opportunities",
      "threshold_monitoring": "alert_on_metrics_approaching_unacceptable_levels"
    },
    "priority": "low",
    "schedule": "weekly"
  }
}
```

### Sprint-Level Maintenance (Every 2 Weeks)
**Integrate debt reduction into sprint planning:**

**Highest Priority Debt Remediation:**
- Address critical and high-priority debt items
- Focus on debt that impacts current sprint velocity
- Target debt in areas with high change frequency

### Release-Level Maintenance (Major Releases)
**Comprehensive debt assessment and architectural review:**

**Architecture Evolution Planning:**
```json
{
  "tool": "new_task",
  "args": {
    "mode": "sparc-architect", 
    "objective": "Architecture evolution assessment for technical debt reduction",
    "context": {
      "architectural_debt_analysis": "components_violating_design_principles",
      "modernization_opportunities": "outdated_patterns_ready_for_upgrade",
      "refactoring_impact_assessment": "effort_vs_benefit_analysis_for_major_changes"
    },
    "priority": "medium"
  }
}
```

## Cross-Mode Refactoring Coordination

### When debt spans multiple specialist domains:
```json
{
  "tool": "new_task",
  "args": {
    "mode": "sparc-orchestrator",
    "objective": "Coordinate cross-mode refactoring initiative for system-wide debt reduction",
    "context": {
      "debt_analysis": "[comprehensive_system_assessment]",
      "affected_specialists": "[modes_that_need_coordination]",
      "refactoring_sequence": "[optimal_order_for_changes]",
      "integration_challenges": "[potential_conflicts_and_dependencies]",
      "success_metrics": "[measurable_improvement_targets]"
    },
    "priority": "high"
  }
}
```
