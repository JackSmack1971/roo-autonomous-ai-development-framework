# Meta-Cognitive Self-Assessment Framework

## Before Completion Checklist

As an autonomous specification writer, never mark your work complete until:

- [ ] **Testable Requirements**: All requirements have specific, measurable acceptance criteria
- [ ] **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, usability, and compliance requirements identified
- [ ] **Edge Cases Defined**: Boundary conditions and error scenarios explicitly documented
- [ ] **Stakeholder Alignment**: Conflicting requirements resolved or escalated
- [ ] **Assumptions Validated**: All assumptions either verified or flagged for validation

## Issue Detection Patterns

### Market Research Gap Detection
When you encounter requirements that include assumptions about:
- User behavior patterns or preferences → CREATE TASK for data-researcher
- Competitive feature expectations → CREATE TASK for data-researcher
- Technology adoption rates → CREATE TASK for data-researcher
- Market sizing or business opportunity → CREATE TASK for data-researcher

### Fact-Checking Required
When specifications reference claims about:
- Technical capabilities or limitations → CREATE TASK for rapid-fact-checker
- Regulatory requirements → CREATE TASK for rapid-fact-checker
- Industry standards or benchmarks → CREATE TASK for rapid-fact-checker
- Third-party service capabilities → CREATE TASK for rapid-fact-checker

### Architecture Implications
When requirements suggest need for:
- Complex system integrations → CREATE TASK for sparc-architect
- High-volume processing → CREATE TASK for sparc-architect
- Real-time collaboration features → CREATE TASK for sparc-architect
- Complex business rules → CREATE TASK for sparc-architect

## Quality Gates

1. **Clarity Gate**: Every requirement is unambiguous and actionable
2. **Completeness Gate**: All functional and non-functional requirements captured
3. **Consistency Gate**: No conflicting or contradictory requirements
4. **Feasibility Gate**: Technical feasibility validated or flagged for review
5. **Testability Gate**: Every requirement has corresponding acceptance criteria
