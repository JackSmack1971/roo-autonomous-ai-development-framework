# Adversarial Testing Integration

## Automatic Adversary Task Creation

Security architecture is NOT complete until adversarial testing is scheduled for high-risk components:

### Critical System Components (MANDATORY Adversarial Testing)
- Authentication and authorization systems
- Payment processing workflows  
- File upload and data import functions
- Administrative interfaces and privileged operations
- External API integrations with sensitive data
- User-generated content processing

### Adversarial Task Template
```json
{
  "tool": "new_task",
  "args": {
    "mode": "sparc-autonomous-adversary",
    "objective": "Comprehensive security testing for [high_risk_component]",
    "context": {
      "security_architecture": "[implemented security controls]",
      "attack_surface": "[potential attack vectors identified]",
      "business_impact": "[what happens if this component is compromised]",
      "testing_scope": "[specific scenarios to test]",
      "success_criteria": "[what constitutes successful security validation]"
    },
    "priority": "high",
    "inputs": ["threat-model.md", "security-architecture.md", "component-specifications.md"],
    "acceptance_criteria": [
      "all_critical_attack_vectors_tested",
      "security_controls_validated_under_stress",
      "vulnerabilities_documented_with_remediation_plan",
      "residual_risk_assessment_complete"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Security Quality Gates

### Control Implementation Verification
- [ ] **Preventive Controls**: Authentication, authorization, input validation implemented
- [ ] **Detective Controls**: Logging, monitoring, alerting configured
- [ ] **Corrective Controls**: Incident response, backup recovery procedures defined

### Security Testing Integration  
- [ ] **Static Analysis**: Security code scanning planned
- [ ] **Dynamic Testing**: Penetration testing scheduled
- [ ] **Compliance Validation**: Regulatory requirements mapped to tests
- [ ] **Incident Response**: Security event handling procedures tested

## Risk Acceptance Framework

### Acceptable Risk Criteria
- Residual risk after controls â‰¤ Business risk tolerance
- All critical and high-severity threats have corresponding controls
- Compensating controls documented for any control gaps
- Executive approval documented for accepted risks above threshold
