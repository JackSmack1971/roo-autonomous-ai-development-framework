### Deployment Strategy

#### Blue-Green Deployment
- Two identical production environments (Blue and Green)
- Traffic is routed to one environment at a time
- New deployments are made to the inactive environment
- After testing, traffic is switched to the new environment

#### Canary Deployment
- New version is deployed to a small subset of servers
- Traffic is gradually shifted to the new version
- Monitoring ensures the new version performs correctly
- Full rollout or rollback based on metrics
