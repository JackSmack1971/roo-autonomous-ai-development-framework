# System Patterns - Enhanced for Autonomous AI Development

## Testing Patterns
- **TDD Pyramid**: Fast unit tests (70%), integration tests (20%), E2E tests (10%)
- **Autonomous Test Creation**: Modes automatically create specialist test tasks when complexity detected
- **Quality-First Testing**: No code completion until >90% test coverage achieved
- **Specialist Test Integration**: Performance, security, and integration testing by dedicated specialists

## Security Patterns
- **Security-First Architecture**: Security architect automatically consulted for all sensitive operations
- **Centralized AuthN/AuthZ**: Single authentication service with distributed authorization
- **Secretless Development**: No credentials in code, environment variables, or configuration files
- **Input Validation Everywhere**: All user inputs validated at boundary and business logic layers
- **Autonomous Threat Detection**: Security gaps automatically detected and routed to security specialists

## Observability Patterns
- **Logs, Metrics, Traces by Default**: Every component includes observability from initial implementation
- **SLOs Per Service**: Service-level objectives defined and monitored for all user-facing services
- **Autonomous Quality Monitoring**: Quality Assurance Coordinator provides real-time system health
- **Predictive Issue Detection**: Quality trends analyzed to prevent issues before they impact users

## Code Quality Patterns
- **Autonomous Refactoring**: Technical Debt Manager proactively identifies and schedules improvements
- **Function Size Limits**: Functions >50 lines automatically trigger code quality specialist review
- **Complexity Thresholds**: Cyclomatic complexity >10 automatically creates refactoring tasks
- **Dependency Management**: Automated vulnerability scanning and update recommendations

## Integration Patterns
- **Contract-First APIs**: API contracts defined before implementation, validated by integration specialist
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous processing with event sourcing for complex workflows
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Graceful degradation for external service failures
- **Autonomous Integration Validation**: Integration complexity automatically detected and delegated

## Performance Patterns
- **Performance-Conscious Design**: Performance implications considered at architecture phase
- **Database Optimization**: N+1 queries and inefficient patterns automatically detected
- **Caching Strategies**: Multi-level caching with appropriate invalidation strategies
- **Load Testing Integration**: Performance requirements validated by dedicated performance engineer

## Collaboration Patterns
- **Specialist Consultation**: Automatic task creation when work exceeds mode expertise
- **Quality Gate Enforcement**: No phase completion without passing quality standards
- **Conflict Resolution**: Evidence-based resolution of technical disagreements
- **Learning Integration**: Successful patterns automatically applied to similar contexts

## Deployment Patterns
- **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure defined in version-controlled code
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Zero-downtime deployments with automatic rollback capability
- **Feature Flags**: Gradual rollout capability with performance and error monitoring
- **Autonomous Deployment Validation**: Platform engineer validates deployment readiness automatically

## Error Handling Patterns
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating with reduced functionality during failures
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All errors logged with sufficient context for debugging
- **Automatic Recovery**: Self-healing systems where possible, clear escalation paths where not
- **Error Boundary Implementation**: React-style error boundaries prevent cascade failures

## Data Patterns
- **Data Integrity First**: ACID compliance for critical transactions, eventual consistency where appropriate
- **Privacy by Design**: Data minimization and user consent integrated into all data handling
- **Backup and Recovery**: Automated backup with tested disaster recovery procedures
- **Autonomous Data Modeling**: Complex data operations trigger database specialist consultation

## Communication Patterns
- **Async First**: Prefer asynchronous communication patterns for better scalability
- **Message Queues**: Reliable message processing with dead letter queue handling
- **API Versioning**: Backward compatibility maintained through proper API versioning
- **Service Discovery**: Dynamic service registration and health checking

## Development Workflow Patterns
- **Feature Branch Strategy**: One feature per branch with automated quality gates
- **Continuous Integration**: All changes validated through automated testing and quality checks
- **Code Review Automation**: Security and quality reviews triggered automatically for sensitive code
- **Documentation as Code**: Technical documentation maintained alongside code changes

These patterns are automatically enforced and optimized by the autonomous AI development system, ensuring consistent high-quality outcomes across all projects.
