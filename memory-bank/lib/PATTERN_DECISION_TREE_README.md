## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 14+ with ES6 modules support
- Pattern storage system (completed in TASK-005)
- Confidence tracking system (completed in TASK-006)

### Installation
```bash
npm install js-yaml
```

### Initialization
```javascript
const PatternApplicationDecisionTree = require('./pattern-application-decision-tree');

const decisionTree = new PatternApplicationDecisionTree({
  autoApplyThreshold: 0.8,      // Confidence threshold for auto-apply
  recommendThreshold: 0.6,      // Confidence threshold for recommendation
  experimentalThreshold: 0.4,   // Confidence threshold for experimental
  deprecatedThreshold: 0.2,     // Confidence threshold for deprecation
  maxHistorySize: 1000         // Maximum decision history size
});

await decisionTree.initialize();
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Pattern Decision Making
```javascript
const pattern = {
  id: "auth_mechanism_undefined_v1",
  name: "Authentication Mechanism Undefined",
  confidence_score: 0.85,
  success_rate: 0.92,
  // ... other pattern properties
};

const context = {
  component_type: "authentication",
  data_sensitivity: "high",
  user_facing: true,
  context_match_score: 0.9,
  risk_level: "medium",
  quality_gates_passed: true
};

// Make decision about pattern application
const decision = await decisionTree.makeDecision(pattern, context);

console.log('Decision:', decision.decision);
console.log('Confidence:', decision.confidence);
console.log('Risk Level:', decision.risk_assessment.level);
console.log('Reasoning:', decision.reasoning);
```

### Decision Making with Custom Tree
```javascript
// Use custom decision tree for specific scenario
const customDecision = await decisionTree.makeDecision(pattern, context, {
  treeId: 'strict_production_tree'
});

// Create custom decision tree
const customTreeConfig = {
  metadata: {
    type: 'pattern_application',
    description: 'Custom decision tree for high-risk environments',
    version: '1.0.0'
  },
  rootNode: 'custom_check',
  nodes: {
    custom_check: {
      type: 'decision',
      condition: (context) => context.confidence_score >= 0.9,
      branches: {
        true: 'auto_apply_outcome',
        false: 'reject_outcome'
      }
    },
    auto_apply_outcome: { type: 'terminal', terminal: 'auto_apply' },
    reject_outcome: { type: 'terminal', terminal: 'reject' }
  }
};

const customTree = decisionTree.decisionEngine.createDecisionTree('custom_tree', customTreeConfig);
```

### Decision Analytics and History
```javascript
// Get decision statistics
const statistics = decisionTree.getDecisionStatistics();
console.log('Total Decisions:', statistics.total_decisions);
console.log('Success Rate:', statistics.success_rate);
console.log('Decision Distribution:', statistics.decision_distribution);

// Get recent decision history
const recentDecisions = decisionTree.getDecisionHistory({
  limit: 10,
  decision: 'auto_apply'
});

recentDecisions.forEach(decision => {
  console.log(`${decision.pattern.name}: ${decision.decision.decision}`);
});
```

};
```

### Context Evaluation
```javascript
const contextFactors = {
  confidence_score: 0.85,           // Pattern confidence score
  success_rate: 0.92,               // Pattern success rate

  hours_since_last_application: 48, // Time since last application
  is_recently_applied: false,       // Recently applied flag
  pattern_maturity: "mature",       // Pattern maturity level
  is_mature_pattern: true          // Mature pattern flag
};
```

## Decision Criteria

### Pattern Eligibility Criteria
1. **Confidence Threshold**: Pattern confidence above deprecated threshold
2. **Application Count**: Pattern has minimum number of applications (default: 1)
3. **Quality Gates**: Quality gates passed (unless in emergency mode)
4. **Recent Application**: Not recently applied (unless human override)
5. **Pattern Status**: Pattern is not deprecated

### High Confidence Criteria
1. **Context Match**: Strong context match (>= 0.8)
2. **Risk Level**: Not high risk (unless emergency mode)
3. **Pattern Maturity**: Pattern is mature
4. **Override Check**: High confidence override conditions not met

### Recommendation Criteria
1. **Context Match**: Adequate context match (>= 0.6)
2. **Success Rate**: Reasonable success rate in similar contexts
3. **Pattern Maturity**: Pattern has sufficient history

### Experimental Criteria
1. **Monitoring**: Monitoring capability available
2. **Risk Level**: Not high risk (unless emergency mode)
3. **Context Match**: Basic context match (>= 0.4)

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Factors
- **Low Confidence**: Pattern confidence below acceptable threshold
- **High Risk Context**: Context has high inherent risk
- **Security Pattern**: Security-related patterns have higher risk
- **Architecture Pattern**: Architecture changes have higher risk
- **Immature Pattern**: New patterns have higher risk
- **Recently Applied**: Recently applied patterns have higher risk

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Low Confidence**: Implement additional monitoring and validation
- **High Risk Context**: Require human approval for application
- **Security Pattern**: Conduct security review before application
- **Immature Pattern**: Apply pattern with enhanced monitoring
- **Recently Applied**: Ensure sufficient time has passed since last application

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategies
- Decision tree evaluation results cached with TTL
- Pattern eligibility checks cached
- Risk assessment results cached
- Context enrichment results cached

### Memory Management
- Decision history size limits to prevent memory leaks
- Tree evaluation statistics with rolling windows
- Event log rotation based on size and age

### Parallel Processing
- Multiple pattern evaluations can run in parallel
- Risk assessment calculations can be parallelized
- Tree traversal optimized for performance

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics
- Decision success rates by outcome type
- Average confidence scores for decisions
- Risk assessment accuracy
- Decision tree evaluation performance
- Pattern eligibility rates

### Alert Conditions
- Decision success rate drops below threshold
- High-risk decisions exceed acceptable rate
- Decision tree evaluation time exceeds limit
- Pattern eligibility rate drops significantly
- Risk assessment accuracy declines

### Event Types
- `decision_made`: Decision completed for a pattern
- `decision_error`: Error occurred during decision making
- `tree_created`: New decision tree created
- `initialized`: System initialization completed

## Best Practices

### Decision Tree Design
1. **Clear Criteria**: Define clear, measurable criteria for each decision point
2. **Risk Awareness**: Always consider risk factors in decision logic
3. **Context Sensitivity**: Use context information effectively in decisions
4. **Override Mechanisms**: Provide mechanisms for human override when needed
5. **Monitoring Integration**: Ensure decisions are monitorable and auditable

### Pattern Evaluation
1. **Comprehensive Context**: Provide complete context information for accurate decisions
2. **Quality Gates**: Ensure quality gates are properly evaluated
3. **Risk Assessment**: Always perform risk assessment for high-impact decisions
4. **Confidence Validation**: Validate confidence scores against historical performance
5. **Override Conditions**: Clearly define conditions for human override

### Performance Considerations
1. **Caching**: Use appropriate caching for frequently evaluated patterns
2. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple patterns together when possible
3. **Async Operations**: Use async operations for I/O intensive tasks
4. **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate limits on concurrent evaluations
5. **Cleanup**: Regularly clean up old decision history and cache

### Error Handling
1. **Graceful Degradation**: Handle errors gracefully with fallback decisions
2. **Error Logging**: Log all decision errors with context
3. **Recovery Mechanisms**: Implement recovery mechanisms for failed evaluations
4. **Timeout Handling**: Set timeouts for long-running evaluations
5. **Circuit Breakers**: Use circuit breakers for external dependencies
