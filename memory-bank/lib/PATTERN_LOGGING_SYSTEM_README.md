## Adaptation Triggers

### Trigger Rules
The system includes several built-in trigger rules:

#### Success Rate Decline
- **Condition**: Pattern success rate falls below 70%
- **Action**: Trigger pattern refinement
- **Priority**: High
- **Cooldown**: 24 hours

#### Failure Pattern Detection
- **Condition**: Pattern failure rate exceeds 30%
- **Action**: Trigger failure analysis
- **Priority**: High
- **Cooldown**: 6 hours

#### Quality Impact Decline
- **Condition**: Pattern quality impact becomes negative
- **Action**: Trigger quality review
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Cooldown**: 18 hours

#### Context Drift Detection
- **Condition**: Pattern ineffective in most contexts
- **Action**: Trigger context refinement
- **Priority**: Low
- **Cooldown**: 48 hours

### Custom Trigger Rules
```javascript
// Add custom trigger rule
logger.trigger.triggerRules.set('custom_trigger', {
  condition: (analysis) => analysis.custom_metric > 0.8,
  action: 'trigger_custom_adaptation',
  priority: 'medium',
  cooldown_hours: 12,
  description: 'Custom trigger based on specific metric'
});
```

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategies
- Pattern analysis results cached with TTL
- Log query results cached for frequently accessed data
- Metrics calculations cached to reduce computation
- Trigger state cached to prevent redundant evaluations

### Memory Management
- Log entries limited by configurable maximum
- Analysis history size controlled
- Automatic cleanup of old log files
- Memory-efficient data structures for large datasets

### Parallel Processing
- Multiple pattern analyses can run in parallel
- Log processing optimized for concurrent operations
- Trigger evaluation distributed across available resources
- Batch operations for bulk log processing

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics
- Pattern application success rates
- Failure rate trends and patterns
- Analysis completion times and success rates
- Adaptation trigger effectiveness
- System resource utilization

### Alert Conditions
- Pattern success rate drops below threshold
- Failure rate exceeds acceptable level
- Analysis processing time exceeds limit
- Adaptation trigger failure rate increases
- Log storage utilization exceeds capacity

### Event Types
- `pattern_application_logged`: Pattern application recorded
- `pattern_failure_logged`: Pattern failure recorded
- `pattern_analysis_completed`: Pattern analysis finished
- `system_analysis_completed`: System analysis finished
- `adaptation_trigger_created`: Adaptation trigger created
- `adaptation_trigger_completed`: Adaptation trigger completed
- `cleanup_completed`: Log cleanup completed

## Data Export and Reporting

### Export Formats
- **JSON**: Complete structured data export
- **CSV**: Tabular data for spreadsheet analysis
- **Summary**: Condensed overview reports

### Export Options
```javascript
// Export all logging data
const jsonExport = await logger.exportLoggingData('json', {
  include_application_logs: true,
  include_failure_logs: true,
  include_audit_logs: true,
  include_analysis_history: false
});

// Export specific pattern data
const patternExport = await logger.logger.exportLogs('csv', {
  pattern_id: 'specific_pattern_id'
});
```

## Best Practices

### Logging Practices
1. **Consistent Context**: Always provide complete context information
2. **Detailed Failure Information**: Include stack traces and recovery actions for failures
3. **Structured Metadata**: Use consistent metadata fields across log entries
4. **Regular Cleanup**: Implement regular log cleanup to manage storage
5. **Security Considerations**: Sanitize sensitive information in logs

### Analysis Practices
1. **Minimum Sample Size**: Ensure sufficient data for meaningful analysis
2. **Trend Sensitivity**: Adjust trend sensitivity based on pattern volatility
3. **Context Completeness**: Provide complete context for accurate analysis
4. **Regular Analysis**: Schedule regular analysis to catch issues early
5. **Actionable Insights**: Focus on generating actionable recommendations

### Adaptation Practices
1. **Trigger Calibration**: Regularly review and calibrate trigger thresholds
2. **Cooldown Management**: Set appropriate cooldown periods to prevent over-triggering
3. **Priority Handling**: Process high-priority triggers before lower-priority ones
4. **Effectiveness Monitoring**: Monitor adaptation effectiveness and adjust rules
5. **Gradual Changes**: Implement adaptations gradually to minimize disruption

### Performance Practices
1. **Log Rotation**: Implement log rotation to manage file sizes
2. **Query Optimization**: Use efficient queries for large log datasets
3. **Caching Strategy**: Implement appropriate caching for frequently accessed data
4. **Resource Limits**: Set resource limits to prevent system overload
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor system performance and adjust configuration as needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### High Log File Sizes
- Increase log rotation frequency
- Implement more aggressive log cleanup
- Review log retention policies
- Consider log compression

#### Analysis Performance Issues
- Reduce analysis window size
- Increase minimum sample size requirements

## Security Considerations

- Log data may contain sensitive application information

- Sanitize sensitive data before logging
- Encrypt log files at rest if containing sensitive information
- Implement audit trails for log access and modification
