## Failed Approaches and Prevention Rules (To Be Populated)

### Failure Template
```yaml
failure_pattern: "[descriptive-failure-pattern]"
failure_indicators:
  - indicator: "[warning sign that led to failure]"
  - impact: "[negative consequence experienced]"
  - frequency: "[how often this failure occurred]"
root_cause: "[underlying reason for failure]"
prevention_rule: "[rule implemented to prevent recurrence]"
alternative_approach: "[successful method to replace failed approach]"
```

### Example Prevention Rule (Framework Design Reference)
```yaml
failure_pattern: "sequential-security-review-late-stage-rework"
failure_indicators:
  - security_review_after_implementation: "60% of reviews required significant rework"
  - architecture_changes_required: "40% needed fundamental architectural changes"  
  - development_cycle_extension: "3x longer cycles due to security retrofitting"
root_cause: "Security considerations impact foundational architectural decisions"
prevention_rule: "Security architect must be consulted immediately after architecture completion"
alternative_approach: "Proactive security architect involvement during architecture phase"
success_rate: "95% elimination of late-stage security rework"
```

## Adaptation Learning (Real-Time Intelligence)

### Dynamic Priority Adjustment Patterns
```yaml

improvement_metrics:
  - resource_utilization: "35% improvement in overall development velocity"
  - blocking_reduction: "60% reduction in work stream blockages"
  - stakeholder_satisfaction: "improved alignment with business priorities"
implementation: "Priority calculation now includes dependency impact and business context"
```

### Context-Aware Mode Selection
```yaml
learning_area: "specialist_routing"
baseline_approach: "Fixed routing rules based on issue type"
adaptation_discovered: "Context-sensitive routing based on project characteristics"

  - regulatory_context: "compliance requirements affecting approach"
```

### Proactive Conflict Prevention
```yaml

  - test_coverage: "specialist improvements include corresponding test updates"
  - integration_reliability: "seamless integration of specialist enhancements"
optimal_timing: "most effective during implementation phase"
```

### Quality-Assured Integration
