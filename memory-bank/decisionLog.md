## Example Autonomous Decision Entries

### 2025-08-25T10:30:00Z - Architecture Security Gap Detected
- **Decision Maker**: sparc-architect  
- **Trigger**: Security implications detected during component interface design
- **Issue**: Authentication mechanism not specified for user management component
- **Detection Pattern**: `authentication_mechanism_undefined` from issue-patterns.yaml
- **Routing Decision**: Created boomerang task for sparc-security-architect
- **Context**: User management component handles sensitive profile data and admin functions
- **Analysis**: Authentication patterns required for secure data access, multiple auth strategies available
- **Decision**: Delegate to security architect for OAuth2/JWT pattern recommendation
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 
  - OAuth2/JWT authentication pattern implemented
  - Role-based authorization controls defined
  - Session management strategy specified
- **Outcome**: [Pending - task created and assigned]
- **Quality Impact**: Prevents downstream security vulnerabilities and compliance issues
- **Learning**: Always validate auth patterns for components handling user data
- **Confidence**: High (similar pattern successful in reference implementations)
- **Follow-up**: Monitor security architect task completion and integration

### 2025-08-25T11:45:00Z - Performance Optimization Required  
- **Decision Maker**: sparc-code-implementer
- **Trigger**: N+1 query pattern detected during user dashboard implementation
- **Issue**: Database queries causing performance bottleneck in user activity feed
- **Detection Pattern**: `n_plus_one_query_patterns` from performance monitoring
- **Routing Decision**: Created task for database-specialist (dynamic mode creation)
- **Context**: Activity feed loads 50+ users with individual profile queries
- **Analysis**: Current implementation causes 51 database queries (1 + 50), acceptable solutions include JOIN queries or batch loading
- **Decision**: Delegate to database specialist for query optimization and caching strategy
- **Priority Elevation**: Medium â†’ High due to user-facing impact
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Query optimization with JOIN or batch loading
  - Database indexing strategy implemented  
  - Performance benchmarks validated (< 100ms response time)
- **Outcome**: [Pending - database specialist task created]
- **Quality Impact**: Prevents user experience degradation and scalability issues
- **Learning**: Early performance validation prevents late-stage optimization scrambling
- **Confidence**: High (performance optimization is well-understood domain)
- **Follow-up**: Performance monitoring alerts configured for similar patterns

## Learning Integration Protocol

### Decision Outcome Tracking
1. **Immediate Impact**: Record short-term effects of decision
2. **Quality Validation**: Measure impact on quality metrics
3. **Business Value**: Assess contribution to project success
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify reusable decision patterns
5. **Failure Analysis**: Document and learn from poor decisions

### Pattern Codification Process
1. **Success Threshold**: Decision must prove successful in 3+ similar contexts
2. **Pattern Documentation**: Create reusable template in delegationPatterns.md
3. **Automation Integration**: Add to issue-patterns.yaml for automatic application
4. **Validation Tracking**: Monitor pattern application success rate
5. **Continuous Refinement**: Update patterns based on ongoing results

### Cross-Project Learning
1. **Pattern Sharing**: Successful patterns shared across projects
2. **Failure Prevention**: Failed approaches documented and avoided
3. **Context Adaptation**: Patterns adapted for different project characteristics
4. **Success Metrics**: Track pattern effectiveness across multiple contexts
5. **Organizational Intelligence**: Build company-wide AI development expertise
