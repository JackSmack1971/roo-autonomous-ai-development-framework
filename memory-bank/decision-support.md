async function makeLearningEnhancedDecision(context, decisionType) {
  // Phase 1: Pre-decision learning consultation
  const guidance = await learningHelpers.preTaskLearningCheck(context, decisionType);

  // Phase 2: Context-aware decision making
  let decision;
  if (guidance.hasGuidance && guidance.guidance.confidence_score >= 0.8) {
    decision = await applyLearningEnhancedDecision(context, guidance.guidance);
  } else {
    decision = await makeStandardDecision(context);
  }

  // Phase 3: Learning validation and quality gates
  const qualityResult = await qualityControl.runQualityGate(
    decision,
    decisionType,
    context
  );

  // Phase 4: Post-decision learning update
  await learningHelpers.postTaskLearningUpdate(
    decisionType,
    qualityResult.passed ? 'success' : 'failure',
    qualityResult.overall_score,
    `Decision made with learning enhancement`
